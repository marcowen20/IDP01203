 * An architectâ€™s fee is calculated as a percentage of the cost of a building. The fee is made up as follows:
 * 8% of the first $5,000.00 of the cost of a building and 
 * 3% on the remainder if the remainder is less than or equal to 
 * 2.5% of the remainder if the remainder is more than $80,000.00.

/**
 * You require an algorithm that will read in the values from an employeeâ€™s timesheet,
 * and calculate and print the weekly pay for that employee. The values read in
 * are the total number of regular hours worked, the total overtime hours and the
 * hourly wage rate. Weekly pay is calculated as payment for regular hours worked,
 * plus payment for overtime hours worked. Payment for regular hours is calculated
 * as (wage rate times regular hours worked); payment for overtime hours worked
 * is calculated as (wage rate times overtime hours worked times 1.5).
